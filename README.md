# Monkey ID game

forked from https://github.com/ashbaldry/Pokemon_20Q

A game I developed for the Cogntivite Ethology Lab at the German Primate Center (DPZ) for Goettingen University's Nacht des Wissens (Night of Science) in 2022. Originally the game included only Guinea baboons. I added Assamese macaques for the *Ich-Du-Wir: Soziale Beziehungen bei Menschen und anderen Primaten* (*Me-You-Us: Social relationships in humans and other primates*) exhibition at the Forum Wissen in Goettingen (Apr-Nov 2024).

The game illustrates the challenge of identifying individual monkeys for field researchers and for machine learning models. The player plays against a (simulated) machine learning classifier to correctly match as many monkey faces as they can over 12 rounds. 
The player can choose the language (German or English) and the species (baboon or macaque) they want to play with.
Players are rewarded with a little piece of trivia about the monkeys, if they get it right, or about a machine learning classifier that is currently being trained, if they get it wrong.
